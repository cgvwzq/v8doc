# V8 docs

I will try to organize a bunch of information and resources that helps ME to ~~understand~~ start with V8.

This is a **WIP**, so you are welcome to give any feedback or correct any error.

Also note that both Chromium and V8 are on working projects, and major changes could occur eventually making parts of this document irrelevant, though I will try to maintain it updated.
